**Important note**

This repository contains work-in-progress state of my ongoing research and implementation of biologically inspired signal propagation framework `DyNA`.

**What is this repository about and what is it for?**

I see some fundamental problems in the conventional approaches to work with complex sequential data and this project is my attempt to workaround some of such problems.

Key feature of the DyNA approach and the main principle could be described as follows:
> _Any transformation (linear or nonlinear) applied to the data should be derived from the data semantics itself._
