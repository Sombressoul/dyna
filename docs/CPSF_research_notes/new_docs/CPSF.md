### Complex Torus

**$\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N := \mathbb{C}^N / \Lambda$** — *compact complex torus*, formed by quotienting complex space $\mathbb{C}^N$ by a discrete full-rank lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{C}^N$, typically $\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^N + i \mathbb{Z}^N$. This generalizes the real torus and supports a global Fourier basis indexed by the dual lattice $\Lambda^* \subset \mathbb{C}^N$.

> **Lattice structure clarification**:
>
> A full-rank lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{C}^N$ is a discrete additive subgroup generated by $2N$ real linearly independent vectors. That is, $\Lambda$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $2N$ spanning $\mathbb{C}^N$ over $\mathbb{R}$.
>
> The torus $\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N = \mathbb{C}^N / \Lambda$ inherits its topology and metric from the Euclidean (Hermitian) norm on $\mathbb{C}^N$, and defines periodicity by identification $z \sim z + \lambda$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$.
>
> The dual lattice $\Lambda^* \subset \mathbb{C}^N$ is defined with respect to the Hermitian pairing $\langle m, z \rangle := \sum_{j=1}^N \overline{m_j} z_j$, and consists of all $m \in \mathbb{C}^N$ such that $\langle m, \lambda \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$.
>
> This Hermitian pairing ensures compatibility with the geometry of $\mathbb{C}^N$, including the unitary structures defined elsewhere in CPSF.
>
> As the dual of a discrete lattice, $\Lambda^*$ is itself discrete and additive.

### Toroidal Spectral Coordinates

**$\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N := \mathbb{C}^N / \Lambda$** — *N-dimensional complex torus*, serving as the toroidal spatial domain for harmonic projection; a compact, orientable, boundaryless complex manifold.

All coordinates $z \in \mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N$ are complex positions modulo the lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{C}^N$. Arithmetic is periodic over $\mathbb{C}^N$ modulo $\Lambda$, enabling toroidal continuity and Fourier projection.

**Spectral Basis** — Global toroidal harmonics $\phi_m(z) := e^{2\pi i \langle m, z \rangle}$, where $m \in \Lambda^*$ and $\langle m, z \rangle := \sum_{j=1}^N \overline{m_j} z_j$, form a complete orthonormal basis in $L^2(\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N)$. They satisfy $\phi_m(z + \lambda) = \phi_m(z) \cdot e^{2\pi i \langle m, \lambda \rangle}$ and are covariant under toroidal shifts.

The phase factor $e^{2\pi i \langle m, \lambda \rangle}$ encodes the shift symmetry of the basis under toroidal translations, ensuring covariance of the harmonic structure with respect to spatial shifts in $z$.

The index $m \in \Lambda^*$ is a discrete spectral vector defining the frequency mode of the harmonic. Each component determines the dual frequency along a corresponding complex lattice direction.

### Projection Coordinates

**$\ell := (z, \vec{d}) \in \mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^N$** — *projection coordinate (ray)*.

Defines the geometric configuration of directional observation or interaction within CPSF.

* **Origin**: $z \in \mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N$ — base point on the complex torus;
* **Direction**: $\vec{d} \in \mathbb{C}^N, \|\vec{d}\| = 1$ — unit complex direction vector;
* The pair $(z, \vec{d})$ defines a unique complex ray in the extended projection space:

$$
z(t) = z + t \cdot \vec{d} \mod \Lambda
$$

---

### Attenuation Parameters

**$\sigma^{\parallel} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$** — *longitudinal attenuation scalar*.

A single positive real value controlling the projection envelope's scale **along the ray direction** $\vec{d}$; determines the effective extent of contribution along the ray.

**$\sigma^{\perp} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$** — *transverse attenuation scalar*.

A single positive real value controlling isotropic decay **in all directions orthogonal to** $\vec{d}$ within the ambient space $\mathbb{C}^N$.

---

### Orthonormal Frame

**$R(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N)$** — *unitary matrix* associated with the direction vector $\vec{d} \in \mathbb{C}^N, \| \vec{d} \| = 1$.

When it exists, it satisfies:

* $R e_1 = \vec{d}$ — the first column aligns with the projection direction;
* $R^\dagger R = I_N$ — the matrix is unitary;
* The remaining $N - 1$ columns span the orthogonal complement of $\vec{d}$ **with respect to the standard Hermitian inner product**.

> **All orthogonality statements are defined with respect to the standard Hermitian inner product in $\mathbb{C}^N$:**
>
> $\langle u, v \rangle := \sum_{j=1}^N \overline{u_j} v_j$
>
> This form of orthogonality is preserved by unitary transformations and defines the geometry of $\mathrm{U}(N)$.

The construction of $R(\vec{d})$ is defined separately (see *CPSF: Orthonormal Frame Construction*).

---

### Extended Orthonormal Frame

**$\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(2N)$** — *block-diagonal unitary matrix* defined as:

$$
\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}) := \mathrm{diag}(R(\vec{d}), R(\vec{d}))
$$

> **Rationale for block-diagonal structure**:
>
> The space $\mathbb{C}^{2N}$ is canonically interpreted as a product of position and frequency spaces: $\mathbb{C}^N_{\text{pos}} \oplus \mathbb{C}^N_{\text{freq}}$. The block-diagonal form of $\mathcal{R}(\vec{d})$ reflects this decomposition, applying the same rotation $R(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N)$ to both the spatial and spectral components. This ensures directional alignment and anisotropic scaling are consistent across both domains when constructing the covariance matrix $\Sigma_j$.

It defines a unitary frame in $\mathbb{C}^{2N}$, aligned with the projection direction $\vec{d} \in \mathbb{C}^N$. Used in the construction of directionally aligned anisotropic structures, such as the geometric covariance matrix $\Sigma_j$.

---

### Geometric Covariance Matrix

**$\Sigma_j \in \mathbb{C}^{2N \times 2N}$** — *anisotropic localization matrix* associated with the projection coordinate $\ell_j = (z_j, \vec{d}_j)$ and attenuation parameters $\sigma_j^{\parallel}, \sigma_j^{\perp} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$.

Defined as:

$$
\Sigma_j := \mathcal{R}(\vec{d}_j)^\dagger \cdot \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_j^{\parallel}, \underbrace{\sigma_j^{\perp}, \dotsc, \sigma_j^{\perp}}_{N-1}, \sigma_j^{\parallel}, \underbrace{\sigma_j^{\perp}, \dotsc, \sigma_j^{\perp}}_{N-1}) \cdot \mathcal{R}(\vec{d}_j)
$$

where:

* $\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}_j) \in \mathrm{U}(2N)$ is the extended orthonormal frame aligned with direction $\vec{d}_j$,
* the diagonal encodes longitudinal scaling along $\vec{d}_j$ and isotropic transverse scaling in the orthogonal complement.

> **Clarification of the diagonal structure**:
>
> The diagonal matrix in the definition of $\Sigma_j$ contains exactly $2N$ entries, organized as two consecutive $N$-dimensional blocks. Each block begins with a longitudinal attenuation scalar $\sigma_j^{\parallel}$ followed by $N - 1$ transverse scalars $\sigma_j^{\perp}$. Explicitly, the diagonal is:
>
> $$
> \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_j^{\parallel}, \underbrace{\sigma_j^{\perp}, \dotsc, \sigma_j^{\perp}}_{N-1}, \sigma_j^{\parallel}, \underbrace{\sigma_j^{\perp}, \dotsc, \sigma_j^{\perp}}_{N-1})
> $$
>
> This ensures full dimensional consistency with $\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}_j) \in \mathrm{U}(2N)$ and preserves the anisotropic structure of the Gaussian envelope in both position and frequency domains.
> The dimension $2N$ arises from the fact that each field contribution $C_j$ is defined over the product space $\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^N \cong \mathbb{C}^{2N}$, and thus its associated Gaussian envelope must be defined on $\mathbb{C}^{2N}$. This justifies the use of an extended orthonormal frame $\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}_j) \in \mathrm{U}(2N)$ and a $2N \times 2N$ covariance matrix.

This matrix defines a local Gaussian envelope aligned with the projection ray, and determines the spatial footprint of the contribution in the complex toroidal domain $\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^N$.

It also defines a geometric coupling between the spatial domain and the higher semantic layer, acting as a weighting function for the influence of semantic content over the toroidal base.

### Spectral Content Vector

**$\hat{T}_j \in \mathbb{C}^S$** — *semantic spectral vector* assigned to a contribution $C_j$.

The dimensionality $S$ is arbitrary and model-defined, representing the number of harmonics stored in the local semantic spectrum.

$\hat{T}_j$ encodes localized semantic content directly in the spectral domain. It is not computed from other values, but defined as an intrinsic, stored parameter of the contribution. While not fixed in the sense of being immutable, it is persistent and modifiable through field operations.

> The vector $\hat{T}_j \in \mathbb{C}^S$ resides outside the toroidal spectral domain and belongs to a higher semantic layer — the second level of the CPSF field. It is not directly embedded in $\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N$, but its effect is made spatially meaningful through the localized weighting induced by $\Sigma_j$. Thus, the toroidal geometry acts as a spatial lens through which semantic content is projected.

---

### Field Contribution

**$C_j := (\ell_j, \hat{T}_j, \sigma_j^{\parallel}, \sigma_j^{\perp}, \alpha_j)$** — *elementary localized excitation in the field*, specified by:

* projection coordinate $\ell_j = (z_j, \vec{d}_j) \in \mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^N$,
* spectral content vector $\hat{T}_j \in \mathbb{C}^S$,
* attenuation scalars $\sigma_j^{\parallel}, \sigma_j^{\perp} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$,
* scalar weight $\alpha_j \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$.

This tuple defines a directionally localized generator of field structure. The geometric part defines a region of influence on the toroidal base, while the semantic part modulates the content delivered into that region. Through their collective interference, such contributions define the emergent semantic field on the second level of CPSF.

---

### Dual Field Structure

**Dual Field Structure** — the foundational architecture of CPSF, consisting of two interdependent levels:

* **Geometric Level (Toroidal)**:
  Defined by the complex torus $\mathbb{T}_\mathbb{C}^N$, which provides a continuous coordinate system equipped with a global spectral basis $\phi_m(z)$. The localization of each field contribution $C_j$ is determined by a Gaussian envelope shaped by the covariance matrix $\Sigma_j$ and attenuation parameters $\sigma^{\parallel}, \sigma^{\perp}$.

* **Semantic Level (Off-Torus)**:
  Represented by spectral content vectors $\hat{T}_j \in \mathbb{C}^S$, which do not reside in the toroidal domain. Their influence is made spatially manifest through the geometry of their corresponding localization envelope in the torus, acting as a weight function.

> The semantic field emerges from the interference of these contributions $C_j$, each coupling its semantic content to a region of the toroidal domain. In this way, the geometry of the torus defines *where* influence occurs, while the spectral vector defines *what* is conveyed — and together, they construct the dual-layer field of CPSF.
