## Orthonormal Frame Construction

### Objective

Construct a smooth local section

$$
R : U \subset \mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit} \to \mathrm{U}(N)
$$

that satisfies the following requirements for each $\vec{d} \in U$:

* (R1) $R(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N)$;
* (R2) For each chart $U_k$, the first column of $R_k(\vec{d})$ equals $\vec{d}$;
* (R3) Columns $\{v_2, \dots, v_N\}$ of $R(\vec{d})$ form an orthonormal basis of $\vec{d}^\perp \subset \mathbb{C}^N$;
* (R4) The map $\vec{d} \mapsto R(\vec{d})$ is $C^\infty$-smooth on $U$;
* (R5) The construction is invariant under right multiplication by $\mathrm{U}(N{-}1)$ on the orthogonal complement of $\vec{d}$;
* (R6) The extended frame $\mathcal{R}(\vec{d}) := \mathrm{diag}(R(\vec{d}), R(\vec{d})) \in \mathrm{U}(2N)$ is consistent;
* (R7) Local trivializations exist and are compatible via $\mathrm{U}(N{-}1)$ transition functions;
* (R8) The construction supports smooth bundle structure over $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit}$;
* (R9) All CPSF-relevant geometric and functional quantities derived from $R(\vec{d})$, including $\Sigma_j$, $\delta \vec{d}$, $w$, $\rho_j(w)$, $\psi_j^{\mathbb{T}}$, and $\Delta \hat{T}_j$, must depend smoothly on $\vec{d}$ with uniform convergence of all derivatives.

Global existence over $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit}$ is topologically obstructed for general $N$, hence the frame is defined locally with smooth transition functions.

### Construction Method (Multi-Chart Atlas)

To ensure global smoothness and avoid linear dependence in Gram–Schmidt, define an atlas:

$$
U_k := \{ \vec{d} \in \mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit} : d_k \neq 0 \}, \quad k = 1, \dots, N
$$

> Define smooth weights

> \sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_i=1.

> R(\vec d)\;:=\;\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_i(\vec d)\;R_i(\vec d)\,

> $$
>
> This weighted blend is $C^\infty$ on $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_{\text{unit}}$, preserves the first column $R(\vec d)e_1=\vec d$, remains unitary, and coincides with a single-chart frame up to $\mathcal O(N^{-p/2})$.

On each chart $U_k$, define the frame as follows.

#### Step 1: First column

Set:

$$
v_1 := \vec{d} \in \mathbb{C}^N
$$

> **Note:** The standard basis ${e_1, \dots, e_N}$ is used uniformly in all charts. No index relabeling (e.g., $e_1 \mapsto e_k$) is performed. The ordering of the basis vectors for orthogonalization is fixed by removing $e_k$ from the list, but the basis itself remains unchanged.

#### Step 2: Construct orthonormal complement via Modified Gram–Schmidt

Let $\mathcal{I}_k := \{1, \dots, N\} \setminus \{k\}$, and let $e_{j_1}, \dots, e_{j_{N-1}}$ denote the standard basis vectors indexed by $\mathcal{I}_k$ in strictly increasing order:

$$
1 \leq j_1 < j_2 < \dots < j_{N-1} \leq N, \quad \{j_1, \dots, j_{N-1}\} = \mathcal{I}_k
$$

Let the ordered list of input vectors be:

$$
[v_1 := \vec{d}, e_{j_1}, e_{j_2}, \dots, e_{j_{N-1}}]
$$

**Apply Modified Gram–Schmidt (MGS):**

Let $u_1 := \vec{d}$. Then, for $m = 2, \dots, N$, define:

$$
w_m^{(0)} := e_{j_{m-1}}
$$

$$
\text{for } l = 1, \dots, m-1:\quad w_m^{(l)} := w_m^{(l-1)} - \langle u_l, w_m^{(l-1)} \rangle u_l
$$

$$
u_m := \frac{w_m^{(m-1)}}{\|w_m^{(m-1)}\|}
$$

Define:

$$
R_k(\vec{d}) := [u_1, u_2, \dots, u_N] \in \mathrm{U}(N)
$$

This version avoids instability of the classical procedure and guarantees exact orthonormality at every step. All operations (inner products, subtractions, norms) are smooth in $\vec{d}$, hence each column $u_m(\vec{d})$ depends smoothly on $\vec{d} \in U_k$.

This guarantees orthonormality and smooth dependence on $\vec{d}$.

> **Uniform derivative bound.**
> For each $\vec d$ at least one weight satisfies $\omega_{k^*}(\vec d)\ge 1/2$ (take $p\ge2$). On that chart $|d_{k^*}|\ge1/\sqrt N$, so all mixed derivatives of the summand $R_{k^*}$ are bounded. The remaining summands are suppressed by the factor $\omega_i\le 1/2$. Hence there exists a constant $C_{N,\alpha}$ such that
> $$
> \displaystyle\sup_{\vec d}\bigl\|\partial^\alpha_{\vec d}R(\vec d)\bigr\|\le C_{N,\alpha}
> $$
> fulfilling R9.

> **Note:** The ordering $j_1 < \dots < j_{N-1}$ is fixed once and for all to ensure canonicity. This eliminates ambiguity from arbitrary permutations and guarantees consistency across charts.

#### Step 3: Transition Functions

> **Remark:** Because the global frame $R(\vec d)$ is defined by a single smooth formula via the weights $\omega_i(\vec d)$, overlaps cause no discontinuities. The original block-diagonal transition matrices remain useful for bundle interpretation but are not needed in the evaluation of $R(\vec d)$.

On overlaps $U_j \cap U_k$, define:

$$
Q_{jk}(\vec{d}) := R_j(\vec{d})^{-1} R_k(\vec{d}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \tilde{Q}_{jk}(\vec{d}) \end{bmatrix},
\quad
\tilde{Q}_{jk}(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N{-}1)
$$

**Smoothness justification:**

* All $R_k(\vec{d})$ are constructed from smooth Gram–Schmidt applied to smooth input sets;
* Their first columns coincide: $R_j(\vec{d}) e_1 = R_k(\vec{d}) e_1 = \vec{d}$;
* Their remaining columns form orthonormal bases of $\vec{d}^\perp$, so the relative basis change lies in $\mathrm{U}(N{-}1)$ and varies smoothly.

> **Smoothness across charts:** Since the ordered list of orthogonalized vectors is constructed using a fixed global indexing convention, and all scalar products and norms are smooth in $\vec{d}$, the resulting transition maps $Q_{jk}(\vec{d})$ are smooth not only within each chart but also across overlaps $U_j \cap U_k$.

**Block structure justification:**

Since both $R_j(\vec{d})$ and $R_k(\vec{d})$ are unitary matrices with identical first columns:

$$
R_j(\vec{d}) e_1 = R_k(\vec{d}) e_1 = \vec{d},
$$

it follows that the transition matrix satisfies:

$$
Q_{jk}(\vec{d}) e_1 = R_j(\vec{d})^{-1} R_k(\vec{d}) e_1 = R_j(\vec{d})^{-1} \vec{d} = e_1.
$$

Thus, $e_1$ is an eigenvector of $Q_{jk}(\vec{d})$ with eigenvalue 1. Since $Q_{jk}(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N)$, it must preserve the decomposition $\mathbb{C}^N = \mathbb{C} e_1 \oplus e_1^\perp$, and hence its matrix representation in the basis $\{e_1, \dots, e_N\}$ has the claimed block-diagonal form:

$$
Q_{jk}(\vec{d}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \tilde{Q}_{jk}(\vec{d}) \end{bmatrix}, \quad \tilde{Q}_{jk}(\vec{d}) \in \mathrm{U}(N{-}1).
$$

> **Cocycle verification:** The cocycle condition $Q_{ij}(\vec{d}) Q_{jk}(\vec{d}) = Q_{ik}(\vec{d})$ follows from associativity of matrix multiplication and the construction $Q_{jk} := R_j^{-1} R_k$. Since all frames $R_j$ are smooth and transition maps are defined via composition of unitaries, the cocycle condition holds identically on triple overlaps $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$.

### Local Trivialization and Bundle Structure

The atlas $\{U_k\}$ provides a full open cover of $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit}$. Each frame map $R_k: U_k \to \mathrm{U}(N)$ satisfies:

* Smoothness of construction;
* Compatibility on overlaps via smooth $\mathrm{U}(N{-}1)$-valued transition functions;
* Cocycle condition $Q_{jk} Q_{kl} = Q_{jl}$.

Thus the construction defines a $\mathrm{U}(N{-}1)$-principal bundle structure over $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit}$.

### Conclusion

The construction uses a full chart atlas over $\mathbb{S}^{2N-1}_\text{unit}$, resolves linear dependence issues, defines smooth transition maps, and satisfies all nine CPSF frame conditions rigorously.

The method is mathematically robust, geometrically faithful to CPSF structure, and analytically ready for implementation in all differential and variational components of the CPSF framework.
